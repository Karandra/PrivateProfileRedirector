;Enables logging for debugging purposes, will increase startup time if enabled. 
;Log file will be created in "My Games\<Game name>\<xSE name (SKSE, F4SE, etc)>\PrivateProfileRedirector.log"
;or, if this location is not accessible, in  "Data\<xSE name>\Plugins\PrivateProfileRedirector.log".
;Disabled by default.
EnableLog=0

;Allows initialization of Script Extender function even when runtime SE version
;does not match SE version for which this plugin was compiled (not recommended).
;Enable this option only in case new game and/or Script Extender version is already released,
;but this plugin has not updated yet.

;and plugin will log all write attempts, but no changes will be written to disk.
;Disabled by default.
WriteProtected=0

;Enables use of native 'WritePrivateProfileString' function to write files.
;Use this, if you experience write issues, like some files being written incorrectly.
;When this enabled 'SaveOnWrite' and 'SaveOnThreadDetach' automatically disabled.
;Disabled by default.

;Saves cached files to disk each time they are written to. Slightly slower performance if enabled.
;With this enabled the ini files are sure to be saved even in case the game crashes for some reason.
;Enabled by default.
SaveOnWrite=1

;When 'SaveOnWrite' is enabled, this option sets maximum number of changes per file before they will be saved to disk.
;For example, 'SaveOnWriteBuffer' is set to '3'. The game made two changes, they are saved in memory but not yet
;saved to disk. The game changes another option and now this INI file will be saved to disk with all three changes.
;Counter resets for this file and after another 3 changes it'll be saved again.
;Disabled by default (0). Possible values: [2, 2000]. If the value is outside of this range the option is considered disabled.
SaveOnWriteBuffer=0

;Trims key names of space characters before they will be passed to INI parser.
