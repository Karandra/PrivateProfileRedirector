[General]
;Enables logging for debugging purposes, will increase startup time and slow down the mod performance if enabled.
;Log file will be created in "My Games\<Game name>\<xSE name (SKSE, F4SE, etc)>\PrivateProfileRedirector.log"
;or, if this location is not accessible, in  "Data\<xSE name>\Plugins\PrivateProfileRedirector.log".
;Differennt log levels log diffent amount of information. The levels are:
;	Disabled = 0,
;	Critical = 1,
;	Error = 2,
;	Warning = 3,
;	Information = 4,
;	Debug = 5,
;	Trace = 6
;Disabled by default (0). Set to Trace (6) to log everything.
LogLevel=0

;Allows initialization of Script Extender function even when runtime SE version
;does not match SE version for which this plugin was compiled (not recommended).
;Enable this option only in case new game and/or Script Extender version is already released,
;but this plugin has not updated yet. This is REALLY UNSAFE option and works on assumption that no
;addresses and offsets has changed between the versions.
;Disabled by default.
AllowSEVersionMismatch=0

;Suppresses all write operations if enabled.
;When enabled options 'SaveOnWrite', 'SaveOnThreadDetach' and 'NativeWrite' will not be automatically disabled,
;and plugin will log all write attempts, but no changes will be written to disk.
;Disabled by default.
WriteProtected=0

;Enables use of native 'WritePrivateProfileString' function to write files.
;Use this, if you experience write issues, such as some files being written incorrectly.
;When this enabled 'SaveOnWrite', 'SaveOnThreadDetach' and 'SaveOnProcessDetach' automatically disabled.
;Disabled by default.
NativeWrite=0

;Saves cached files to disk each time they are written to. Slightly slower performance if enabled.
;With this enabled the ini files are sure to be saved even in case the game crashes for some reason.
;Enabled by default.
SaveOnWrite=1

;When 'SaveOnWrite' is enabled, this option sets maximum number of changes per file before they will be saved to disk.
;For example, 'SaveOnWriteBuffer' is set to '3'. The game made two changes, they are saved in memory but not yet
;saved to disk. The game changes another option and now this INI file will be saved to disk with all three changes.
;Counter resets for this file and after another 3 changes it'll be saved again.
;Disabled by default (0). Possible values: [2, 2000]. If the value is outside of this range the option is considered disabled.
SaveOnWriteBuffer=0

;Saves all cached files to disk each time a game thread exits.
;With this enabled the ini files will be saved periodically and will probably be saved in case the game crashes for some reason.
;Disabled by default.
SaveOnThreadDetach=0

;Saves all cached files to disk on DLL unload (usually on this happens when the game exits).
;Enabled by default.
SaveOnProcessDetach=1

;Saves all cached files to disk before saving the game.
;Enabled by default.
SaveOnGameSave=1

;Enables support for inline comments for values.
;If enabled these comments will not be preserved, but value will be correctly read.
;Otherwise comments will be read as part of value.
;Enabled by default.
